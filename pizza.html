    <h3>Step 2 Prepare the pizza base</h3>

    <p>Preheat the oven at 180 degree Celsius. Now, is the time to make the pizza base when the dough is ready. Dust the
        space a little using dry flour and take a large amount of the pizza dough. Using a rolling pin, roll this dough
        into a nice circular base. (Note: Make sure that the circular base is even at all ends.) Once you have made the
        base, use a fork and prick the base with it so that the base doesn't rise and gets baked nicely. Put it into the
        preheated oven and bake it 10 minutes. Now, your pizza base is ready.</p>

    <h3> Step 3 Chop all the vegetables for the pizza </h3>
    <p> Now, wash the capsicum and slice it thinly in a bowl. Then, peel the onions and cut thin slices of it as well in
        another bowl. And finally, cut tomatoes and mushrooms in the same manner. However, make sure that those tomatoes
        have less juice in them. Once all the veggies are done, Now, grate the processed and mozzarella cheese in
        separate
        bowls.</p>

    <h3> Step 4 Spread the sauce and veggies on the base</h3>
    <p> Then, take the fresh pizza base and apply tomato ketchup all over. Spread half the processed cheese all over the
        base and evenly put the veggies all across the base. Once you have put all the veggies, put a thick layer of
        mozzarella cheese.</p>

   <h3> Step 5 Bake the pizza at 250 degree Celsius for 10 minutes</h3>
  <p>  Put this pizza base in a baking tray and place it inside the oven. Let the pizza bake 10 minutes at 250 degree
    Celsius. Once done, take out the baking tray and slice the pizza. Sprinkle oregano and chilli flakes as per your
    taste and serve hot. (Note: Make sure that the oven is preheated at 250 degree Celsius for 5 minutes at least.)</p>
